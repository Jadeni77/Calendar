Controller:
* Instead of printing Welcome and the entire menu, only print welcome and ask the user to
type menu if they want to see the menu.
* Change the knownCommand field from private to protected, so it can be accessed from
the new extended subclass.

CalendarModelTest:
* Change the test from throwing NullPointerException to throwing IllegalArgumentException.

ControllerTest:
* Change the first two helper methods (for testing purposes)

ICalendar and ICalendarModel:
* Change the addEvent methods from private to public and add it to the interface. The reason for
this change is because it allows the CopyEventCommand to access the addEvent method directly,
which is necessary for its functionality.

MenuCommand:
* Add the new Operations to the menu.

CreateCommand:
* shorten the regex in pattern.compile
